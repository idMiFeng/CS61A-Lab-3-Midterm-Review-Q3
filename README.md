CS61A Lab 3: Midterm Review Q3 K Runner about how to separate data of type int from increasing sequences
As for lab3, Q3 is the most difficult for me, so I only put the analysis of this problem, using the language python, and other problems that need to be analyzed can be contacted. The idea of solving this problem is my own, which may be more complicated. If there is a simpler algorithm, I hope you can leave a message and contact for learning.
